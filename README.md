# Ghost Extract 'n' Pack

**doesn't seem to really work. it can autosave the match replace, and you can see the ghosts in mediatracker (edit a replay), but when they are repacked the replays have no ghost. the time is recorded tho. (play > local > against a replay). opening the repacked replay in replay editor doesn't show a ghost, either.**
